Game mode does NOT support multiplayer.
Unique weapon Flamethrower
	Uses lighting, and additive blending with depth disabled to give a cool fire effect.
Fail the assignment game mode
	My unique game mode features a linear story that players progress though by discovering bugs and lowering the grade of the assignment. It's 	kind of like a parody Doomenstein Gold. In order to beat the game you must progress until the grade shown in the top right corner drops 	to zero. Advance dialog with the space key. All other controls are the same and displayed in the dev console.
Unique Enemy Binkey
	He is a special little guy.
